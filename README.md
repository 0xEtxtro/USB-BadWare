you need a program that make the usb support AUTORUNS ex USB AutoRun Creator
after that you should make the usb run the VICTIM.py script as autorun via the program 
and we are done for the usb.
just run the hacker.py on your machine before plug the usb on victim machine 
NOTE:: you may need for the victim machine to have program for auto runs try the one above
and yes you can replace the victim.py with reveseshell of your own but it will get caught from AV.
