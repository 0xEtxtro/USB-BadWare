you need a program that make the usb support <b>AUTORUNS</b> ex USB AutoRun Creator<br>
after that you should make the usb run the <b>VICTIM.py</b> script as autorun via the program<br> 
and we are done for the usb.<br>
just run the <b>hacker.py</b> on your machine before plug the usb on victim machine <br>

<h2>NOTE</h2> you may need for the victim machine to have program for <b>autoruns</b> try the one above
and yes you can replace the victim.py with reveseshell of your own but it will get caught from AV.
